# Image effects.

It's a small post processing demo where you can use the 4 buttons to change or clear the effects on screen.

## Features.

- [Scripted post processing effects](https://github.com/W0kest/Post-processing/blob/master/Image-Effects/Assets/Scripts/Effects.cs)

## Software Analyse.

### Unity3d engine.

Objective;

- It has built in post processing features.
- The post processing features are a bit hidden.
- It works in C#, but could also be handled from within the engine.
- You had to dig quite a bit in order to find out how to script with it.

Subjective;

- I've got lots of experience with the engine.
- The workflow feels nice because it's simple.
- The post processing feature is hard to get into.

### Python.

Objective;

- It doesn't have any GUI unles you use libraries.
- There are libraries for the effects.

Subjective;

- I don't have any prior knowledge on this language, so I could learn a lot.
- It would take a lot of time to research how to get everything on screen.

### Unreal4 engine.

Objective;

- It has built in post processing features.
- The features are hidden very well.
- It works in C++ and UEBlueprints, but it could also be handled from within the engine.

Subjective;

- I don't have any experience with this engine.
- I don't have any knowledge on C++, so I could learn a lot from it.

### Conclussion.

In the end, I chose to work with Unity3D, because I have the most experience with it, and I like to have some familiarity when I do something new. And that I find it interesting to build scenes, and how one could change the athmosphere of a room by changing a single value.

## Learning goals.

- How post processing works, and how to use it.
- How to create effects without using the particle system.
- That I gain more knowledge on camera effects.
- How to build the scene better.

## Planning.

| | maandag | dinsdag | woensdag | donderdag | vrijdag |
| | | | | | |
|week 1 | | Created the repo and the ReadME. | | | |
|week 2 | | Testing with values in the Post Processor. | Creating the script that handles the effects | Adding UI elements and a bit of finalisation. | Wrap up and hand in. |
